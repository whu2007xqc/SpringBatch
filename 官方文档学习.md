## 3. Domain Language of Batch
### Job
job的层次依次分为Job、JobInstance，JobExecution。

> In Spring Batch, a Job is simply a container for Step instances. It combines multiple steps that belong logically together in a flow and allows for configuration of properties global to all steps, such as restartability. The job configuration contains:
> * The simple name of the job.  
> * Definition and ordering of Step instances.  
> * Whether or not the job is restartable.  

创建一个SimpleJob：
```java
@Bean
public Job footballJob() {
    return this.jobBuilderFactory.get("footballJob")
                     .start(playerLoad())
                     .next(gameLoad())
                     .next(playerSummarization())
                     .build();
}
```

#### JobParameter
> "How is one JobInstance distinguished from another?" The answer is: JobParameters. 
> A JobParameters object holds a set of parameters used to start a batch job. They can be used for identification or even as reference data during the run.
> Thus, the contract can be defined as: **JobInstance = Job + identifying JobParameters** .

注意JobExecution参数：  
* Status： A `BatchStatus` object that indicates the status of the execution. While running, it is BatchStatus#STARTED. If it fails, it is BatchStatus#FAILED. If it finishes successfully, it is BatchStatus#COMPLETED
